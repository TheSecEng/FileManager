When, in this documentation, I'm talking about settings *in general*, I'm talking about FileManager's settings.

## Quick reminder

There's two "type" of settings.

#### 1: The global settings. Here's the hierarchy:

> Below, you can see the order in which Sublime Text would process a hypothetical hierarchy of settings for Python files on Windows:
>
> 1. Packages/Default/Preferences.sublime-settings
> 2. Packages/Default/Preferences (Windows).sublime-settings
> 3. Packages/AnyOtherPackage/Preferences.sublime-settings
> 4. Packages/AnyOtherPackage/Preferences (Windows).sublime-settings
> 5. Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings
> 6. Settings from the current project
> 7. Packages/Python/Python.sublime-settings
> 8. Packages/Python/Python (Windows).sublime-settings
> 9. Packages/User/Python.sublime-settings
> 10. Session data for the current file
> 11. Auto-adjusted settings

#### 2: The packages settings.

They don't affect anything, except ... the plugin. They have 2 files, with the same name: one in the package folder, the other in you `User` directory. This is the case for FileManager. And this file is called ... `FileManager.sublime-settings`. So, the file in the package directory is the default one, and the one in the user directory **overwrites** them.

### So, which one are you talking about then?

The second one.

### How do I edit them?

There's a few different ways:

- `Preferences -> Packages Settings -> FileManager`
- Open the command palette (<kbd>ctrl+shift+p</kbd>), and find `Preferences: File Manager Settings`

The file on the left is the default one (don't edit it, just look at it), and the one on the right is yours, have fun with it!

### An example to make sure you understand...

> In your [settings](settings.md), you can specify an option: `aliases`. It has to be an object.

    The FileManager's settings (the second one)

## A few useful settings

This section is going to show you different settings that aren't specific to any command, that's
why they have they're own.

- `explicitly_refresh_sidebar` Each time you run a command that affects any file, if this option
is set to true, FileManager will refresh the sidebar for you. Note that you can do this by running
`Project: Refresh Folders` in the command palette.
- `show_*_command` Each FileManager's command has a settings starting with `show_`, the command
name without the `fm_` and finishing by `_command`. If set to `false`, this command
will *always* be hidden (in the command palette, and the context menus)

!!! note
    To know the command name of a FileManager's command, just refer to the
    [command page](../commands.md) page. It's mentioned below each main title.
